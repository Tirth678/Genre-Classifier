<h1>Music Genre Prediction using Decision Trees</h1>
<br>
<p>This repository contains a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts the music genre preferences of users based on their age and gender. The model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier and achieves an accuracy of 75%+ in prediction.<p>
<br><br>
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<br>
<h2>Goal: Predict the genre of music a person might prefer given their age and gender.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Input: Age (numeric), Gender (categorical).</h2>
<br>
<h2>Output: Predicted Music Genre (categorical).</h2>
<br>
<h2>Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier.<h2>
<br>
<h2>Accuracy: Above 75% on the test dataset.<h2>
<br>
<h2>Extras: The decision tree visualization is provided to demonstrate how the model makes decisions step by step.</h2>
<br>
This project is great for beginners who want to understand:
<br>
How to prepare datasets for ML.
<br>
How to use Decision Trees.
<br>
How model accuracy is measured.
<br>
<br>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<br>
<h2>Collect Data</h2>
  <br>
<p>A dataset of users with their age, gender, and preferred music genre is used.</p>

Preprocess Data

Male/Female encoded into categorical values.

Training/testing split performed.

Train Model

The Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the dataset.

Evaluate Accuracy

Model performance checked on test data.

Achieved accuracy: >75%.
